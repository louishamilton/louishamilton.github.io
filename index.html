    <h1>The Story of the US Stock Market</h1>
    <h3>S and P 500 Price Over Time</h3>
    <div id="slide1">
    </div>
    <p>We start with an overview of the full history of US stock prices. Data is from https://stooq.com/q/d/?s=^spx&i=d. I assume that the values from before the S and P 500 offically existed are a simulation of the theoretical top 500 weighted index of US stocks across history. This narrative visualization breaks down the history of the US stock market into three distinct time periods. First, from 1789 through 1835, the stock market grew at a fast rate despite the ups, downs, and inconsistentcies of the young market. Next, from 1835 to 1942, there were 107 years of near zero growth - thanks in no small part to the Great Depression. Finally, from 1942 to the current day (2024), we have seen outstanding and consistent stock growth. Navigate through the slides to investigate each time period in more detail.
