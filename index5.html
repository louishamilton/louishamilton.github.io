    <p>Now it's time to write your own story. Use the date selectors above to choose a date range to view. Then click the "Apply" button to apply the date range to the chart. In the previous slides I have described three distinct periods of the US stock market. However, there is more than one way to look at things. For example, 1900 to 1930 saw strong stock growth despite being part of the Lost Century. Perhaps you can think of impactful historical events not mentioned here and look for the impact on stock prices. I invite you to discover your own story of the US stock market.</p>
